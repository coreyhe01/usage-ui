# Usage UI – v1.1 "Call to Action"

This project is a lightweight awareness tool designed to help users understand when their ChatGPT session limits will likely reset — and to gather structured, frictionless community feedback.

It comes in two versions:
- 🧩 A **browser extension** (Edge/Chrome compatible)
- 🌐 A **web version** (GitHub Pages-hosted, no install required)

---

## 🌟 Why This Exists

Power users frequently run into GPT-4 usage limits without warning. OpenAI does not currently expose usage APIs or provide real-time feedback in the UI. This tool was created to:

- Raise awareness about opaque reset behavior
- Offer a **frictionless**, low-barrier way to anticipate reset timing
- Provide an equally frictionless path for community feedback
- Advocate for native improvements in the ChatGPT user experience

| 🧭 Clock-based only | Timer uses your system time and assumes 3-hour reset blocks |
| 🔄 No sync | Sessions aren’t synced across devices or browsers |
| 📉 Passive estimates | This tool does not read usage count or state from ChatGPT itself |

## 👋 Contribute or Share

This is an open prototype — made with the community in mind.  
Fork it, remix it, or point OpenAI to it.

Let’s make friction visible. Let’s drive the conversation forward so that OpenAI includes expectation setting during a session for usage so you don't get stuck in loops of lost dialogue or processing
